# PY2_copy_file_to_clipboard


I believe you can easliy find tons of examples to copy file to clipboard (especially image files) using python2, but they are bascially the same logic => read the file out, (convert to bmp format - in image case) and set to the clipboard. This is an easy but heavy way, cause you are using so much memories and increased quit a lot file size (image case). 


Here is an easy way of setting file to clipboard, using file pointer,  this is the same operation as you select a file and hit ctrl + c on keyboard. 

Hope it's useful for you. U
